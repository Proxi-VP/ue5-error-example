Instructions on how to setup this example.

## Step 1: <br />
When grabbing this repo from github make sure the destination is located in either 'C:\GIT' or 'D:\GIT'.
If you dont have the 'GIT' folder please create it and make the repo destination inside the 'GIT' folder. if you dont have either drive or wish to 
change the repo location inside the '.install' folder where the 'init_unreal' file lives, please change those locations to match where you pulled the 
repo to.

## Step 2: <br />
place both the 'unreal-debug' and 'unreal-dev' files in your 'Documents' folder as noted in the 'dev.py' file.

## Step 3: <br />
place the 'init_unreal' file thats located in the '.install' folder in '\Documents\UnrealEngine\Python', if you do not have those folders, please create them 
as they are necessary to run the bootstrapper.

## Step 4: <br />
install unreal engine 5 from epic games launcher and create a new project. once the project has been created, in 'My Projects' tab, launch the project and let the bootstrapper run. Once the bootstrapper has finished you should see a 'Developer' tab on the top row, Click that and then click 'debugSystemTime' to see the error.
